# Promise
## Tutorial for the 'Promise'_


When I started learning 'Promise' I found over the net a plenty of example, confused and partial. So I decided to merge all that knowledge to realize this tutorial to explain how the Promise works.   ,

This tutorial is made with a mixed technique that uses the browses as IDE. There are:
- a 'frontend'(the page) with some description of the main concept.
- a 'backend' (the code) running javaScript from where to learn exactly how the promise work and the right way to programming it

All the tutoria is divided in sections. Each section analize one aspect of the Promise and the js code for each section stay on its own file.
To switch between 'theory' and 'practice' keep the browse in debug mode (F12) and click the buttons: the right code will be shown 

Enjoy
